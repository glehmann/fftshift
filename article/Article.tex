\begin{abstract}
\noindent
% The abstract should be a paragraph or two long, and describe the
% scope of the document.

A common usage when working with Fourier transform is to shift the
the image to put the zero-frequency component in the center of the
image. This contribution comes with a filter to perform this
transform.

\section{Description}

This filter is multitreaded and works with any dimensions or size of image, and with any pixel type.
It is very similar to the fftshift and ifftshift function of matlab.

When the size of the image is odd on one dimension or more, performing the
transform twice will not produce the same image than the input, as shown in
the Figure 2. To get it right, the option \verb$SetInverse(true)$ has
to be used.

\end{figure}

\subfigure[shifted image, with Inverse = false]{\includegraphics[scale=38.1]{shifted5X5}}
\subfigure[the image shifted twice, with Inverse = false for the first run, and Inverse = true for the second]{\includegraphics[scale=15]{5X5}}
\subfigure[the imageshifted twice, with Inverse = false for both the first and the second run. The input image is not restored.]{\includegraphics[scale=38.1]{nonInverse5X5}}
\caption{Result of the transforms on an image with an odd size (5x5).}
\end{figure}


\section{Code sample}

The filter is very simple, and there shouldn't be any problem to use it. Please
look at check.cxx in the tar ball for an example.
